- Convert to python 3 :-(

- Each image should link to the real XKCD site (and so should the title above it, which should include the real title of the comic)

- Show tooltip text beneath each result

- Support multiple Keywords (with nice UI support too)

- Find decent CSS for the input bar to look OK

- Tweak the scores a bit for better results

- Set a minimal score value under which it should not be considered a hit for that comic

- Set max results back to 10
