- Make the homepage look like something...

- Stop removing "'" for the title and tooltip :-)

- Support multiple Keywords (with nice UI support too)

- Find decent CSS for the input bar to look OK

- Tweak the scores a bit for better results

- Set a minimal score value under which it should not be considered a hit for that comic

- Convert to python 3 :-(
